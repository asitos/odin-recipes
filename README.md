# 🐾 My Practice HTML Website

a simple, aesthetic practice project using only HTML (and optionally CSS)  
built to learn structure, tags, and create pages that feel soft, personal, and expressive.  

project live at: https://asitos.github.io/odin-recipes/

## 💡 what's in this project?

- multiple HTML pages (`index.html`, `love.html`, `cement.html`, etc.)
- basic navigation using `<a>` links
- custom content with text, images, and lists
- structured semantically using headings, paragraphs, and sections
- no JavaScript or frameworks — just vanilla cuteness
